# F5 Distributed Cloud CDN Service Chaining

The F5 XC CDN works like Matryoshka dolls (aka stacking dolls). The CDN would be to outer shell, the WAAP & HTTP Loadbalancer the next layer and inside, hidden & protected, stay the origion servers.

The traffic flow would then look like this:

## Step-by-step configuration guide

### Prerequisites

* DNS Delegation must be properly setup. This usually requires some config with your DNS provider.

### Step 1: Configure HTTP Loadbalancer & WAAP Policy

1. Navigate to the Web App & API Protection tile on the home screen.

2. Click on + Add HTTP Load Balancer and configure: 
  * Name
  * A domain (this is not the domain you will use for publishing. I choose protected.mydomain.com)
  * The Load Balancer Type to be HTTP with Automatic Certificate
  * HTTP to HTTPS Redirection
  * An Origin Pool 
  * Add or create & add a WAF

3. Try to access your site from the domain you used above. Should work. Otherwise... fix it.

### Step 2: Configure CDN

1. Navigate to the Content Delivery Network tile on the home screen. See above, Step 2.1.

2. Click on + Add Distribution and configure:
  * Name
  * A domain (this is the domain you will use for publishing. I choose www.mydomain.com)
  * HTTP to HTTPS Redirection
  * A CDN Origin Pool. Add the domain you used for the Load Balancer created above in Step 2.2.

### Testing WAAP

For testing the WAAP functionality, you could append a simple script tag as a query string and check that it get's blocked

### Testing CDN

When accessing the site for the first time, the CDN should be empty and the relevant HTTP header should show a miss.

![cdn_cache_miss](assets/cdn_cache_miss.png)

After 2-3 refreshes (Ctrl+Shift+R) this should change to a cache hit.

And also from another GEO location, you should see a different value in the `X-Volterra-Location` header.

### Remarks

#### Cache Control
The F5 XC CDN service honors the `cache-control` header returned by your origin application. If `cache-control` is not returned by your origin application, the CDN service does not consider the response cacheable. A simple valid example for NGINX would like like this:

```
location ~* \.(css|js|gif|jpg|png)$ {
 expires 4h;
 add_header Cache-Control "public";
}
```

The tilde-asterisk (~*) makes it a case-insensitive matching for all file types in the brackets. Those items should be cached for four hours and the `public` response directive indicates that the responses can be stored in a shared cache.
